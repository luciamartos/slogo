## Estimation: before looking at the old code:
#### how long do you think it will take you to complete this new feature?
1.5 hrs
#### how many files will you need to add or update? Why?
The controller which creates Nodes

## Review: after completing the feature:
#### how long did it take you to complete this new feature?
1 hr

#### how many files did you need to add or update? Why?
I changed 3 classes, the tab view controller which created the nodes, the interface that told the back end that the image should be changed and the back end itself that changed the image of the turtle with a given ID.

#### did you get it completely right on the first try?
No, I needed to remind myself how things worked in the project at first but it didnt take too long to figure it out.

## Analysis: what do you feel this exercise reveals about your project's design and documentation?
#### was it as good (or bad) as you remembered?
The design was fine there is just a lot of sloppiness in the coding itself, the tab view controller should really have been refractored and delegated jobs. It made it a bit difficult to navigate and see what was going on where.

#### what could be improved?
As I had just mentioned I think the biggest area of improvement here is in delegating jobs to other classes and refractoring the TabViewController.

#### what would it have been like if you were not familiar with the code at all?
It would definitely have taken longer to figure out what should be added where but it is pretty straight forward and would not have been a very painful experience.
